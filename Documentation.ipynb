    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Harry Markowitz developed the Markowitz model in 1952. Also referred to as the mean-variance model, it is an essential component of contemporary portfolio theory. It assists investors in creating portfolios that maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given level of return by optimizing capital allocation among various assets. The minimize function from the Python scipy.optimize module is used to tackle the quadratic optimization issue that the Markowitz model is formulated as in this study. The objective is to investigate different situations, modify limitations, and assess how these affect portfolio optimization.\n"
