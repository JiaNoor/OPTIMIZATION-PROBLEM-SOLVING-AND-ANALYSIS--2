    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Harry Markowitz developed the Markowitz model in 1952. Also referred to as the mean-variance model, it is an essential component of contemporary portfolio theory. It assists investors in creating portfolios that maximize returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given level of return by optimizing capital allocation among various assets. The minimize function from the Python scipy.optimize module is used to tackle the quadratic optimization issue that the Markowitz model is formulated as in this study. The objective is to investigate different situations, modify limitations, and assess how these affect portfolio optimization.\n"

    "\n",
    "This study investigated the use of Python quadratic programming to optimize portfolios through the Markowitz model. We offered a thorough examination of the ways in which these adjustments affect portfolio risk and return by tackling four different jobs with different limitations and situations. The efficient frontier's expansion with fractional capital investment, the impact of permitting short sales, and the enhanced flexibility and possible returns with loosened return limits are among the important conclusions. Implementation challenges included making sure the process was repeatable, building precise matrices, and formulating strong optimization problems were all solved with suitable methods. All things considered, this research advances knowledge of risk-return trade-offs and provides insightful information for creating"
