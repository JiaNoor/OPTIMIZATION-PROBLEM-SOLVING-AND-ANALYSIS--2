    "\n",
    "This report inspects the utilisation of quadratic programming to advance venture portfolios utilising the Markowitz model. Here advancing portfolios means to get the thought where to contribute and what might be the base and most extreme gamble consider that speculation. Four errands with different requirements and situations are addressed offering hypothetical experiences recognising difficulties and introducing viable outcomes. The analysis of what actually these progressions mean for portfolio hazard and return by surveying the outcomes of different expected returns fractional capital ventures changed return cutoff points and short selling had performed. Improving the making of speculation systems through a more exhaustive cognisance of chance return compromises under different conditions is the point.\n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markowitz model frequently known as the mean-difference model was made by Harry Markowitz in 1952 and is a crucial part of the present day portfolio hypothesis. By boosting capital distribution among different resources it helps financial backers in building portfolios that expand returns at a specific gamble level or limit risk. In this review the Markowitz model is figured out as a quadratic enhancement issue which is settled with an open-source Python curved improvement module called CVXPY. By adjusting the limits researching different circumstances and assessing what they mean for portfolio streamlining is the aim.\n"

    "The Markowitz model works on the following assumptions:\n",
    "- Investors are risk-averse preferring portfolios that offer higher returns with lower risk.\n",
    "- The risk of a portfolio is based on the variability of its returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses the following parameters:\n",
    "- μ: vector of expected returns for n assets\n",
    "- C: covariance matrix of asset returns\n",
    "- x: vector of portfolio weights\n",
